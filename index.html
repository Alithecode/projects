        <hr>
        <p> My favourite hobby is soccer. I love soccer because its promotes teamwork and sharing. Playing soccer is great exercise that improves cardiovascular health, increases coordination, improves strength and enhances flexibility and boosts self-confidence and self-esteem. Playing soccer doesn't just improve your physical health, but can help improve your mood as well. I love some players like Messi and Ronaldo but even the old players like Zidane, Pele and Ronaldo  are really good. Soccer can teach us the meaning of hard work. All the profesional players have done hard work to get to their postion. Soccer is also one of the most popular sport in the world. I started to play soccer in 2017 becuase I had seen a match and was really into soccer. I player soccer with my firends and slowly turned better. Now I go to a soccer club and i still love it.</p>
